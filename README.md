Newmeet is an opensource extension for taking statistical data of participants in Google Meets. It's not an official extension developed by Google Inc. so incompatability issues are expected. Google doesn't provide an API for Google Meet, making working with such an extension hard. This extension works by scraping web page data and utilising it for getting detail's of particpants such as profile image, Name, Join leave information, etc... all the data scraped by this extension will be kept on your own device and Newmeet won't keep any data. This extension is not supposed to work with mobile devices but can be installed via Firefox Android for regular usage(we don't recommend it).
